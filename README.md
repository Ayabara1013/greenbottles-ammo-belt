# greenbottles-ammo-belt

This module adds some new ammo types for use with projectile weapons, in case you want some variance with your pew pews and your dakka dakkas!! do you feel like some dakka needs to be bigger than other dakka? MOAR DAKKA!!!

If you are enough of a madlad that you want to support me, [I set up a patreon where you can get access to all the early stuff I'm working on and more!](https://www.patreon.com/cw/GreenbottlesArcanum) < thats a link, click it. *insert fry futurama money meme* 

If you want to just support me once, here's a KoFi link! https://ko-fi.com/greenbottle

## useage instructions:
1. right click and import all ammo from the included compendium (or do it individually for just some of them)
2. edit a weapon
3. go to details
4. change ammo type to "GB's _"
5. weapon will now use that ammo! 

### notes
- eg, you can switch a pistol to gb's light ammo and it will only be able to take that ammo
- this is entirely for flavour, and does not affect the operation of the weapon being used other than making you use a specific type of ammo instead of the same loose "projectile ammo" that goes in every gun.
